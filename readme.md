# üß© DSA Study using Golang

This repository contains structured lessons for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Golang**.  
Each **category** (e.g., Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, etc.) contains multiple **problems**, and each problem has one or more **solutions** exploring different algorithmic strategies.

## How to install & use
### Fully interactive (asks everything)

```bash
./dsa.sh category --interactive         # To create category
./dsa.sh problem --interactive          # To create problem
./dsa.sh solution --interactive         # To create solution
```

```bash
# Save
nano dsa.sh   # paste the script, save

# Make executable
chmod +x dsa.sh

# Create a category
./dsa.sh category --cat 1 --label "Arrays & Hashing"

# Add a problem (auto-picks next problem-XX)
./dsa.sh problem --cat 1 --prob auto --title "Contains Duplicate" --difficulty Easy --tags "Arrays,Hashing"

# Add a second problem later (no need to touch existing files)
./dsa.sh problem --cat 1 --prob auto --title "Valid Anagram" --difficulty Easy --tags "Arrays,Hashing,Strings"

# Add solutions any time (auto-picks next solution-XX)
./dsa.sh solution --cat 1 --prob 1 --sol auto --title "Solution-01: Brute Force" --approach "Brute Force" --tags "Brute Force,Intro"
./dsa.sh solution --cat 1 --prob 1 --sol auto --title "Solution-02: Sorting" --approach "Sorting" --tags "Sorting,Array"
