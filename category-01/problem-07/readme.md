## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Each product is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n) time without using the division operation?

#### ▶️ Example 1:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]

Output: [48,24,12,8]
```

#### ▶️ Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]

Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
```

## 🎯 Constrains
* 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
* -20 <= nums[i] <= 20

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
