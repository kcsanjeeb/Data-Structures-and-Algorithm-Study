## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

#### ▶️ Example 1:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

Output: [2,3]
```

#### ▶️ Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

Output: [7]
```

## 🎯 Constrains
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
* -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
* 1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
