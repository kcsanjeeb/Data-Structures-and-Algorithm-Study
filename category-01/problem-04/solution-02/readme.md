## üîç Idea
* Use character frequency arrays as keys for grouping anagrams
* All anagrams have identical character frequency distributions
* Use fixed-size arrays as map keys for efficient grouping

## üß© Steps
1. Create a hash map with frequency arrays as keys and string groups as values
2. For each string in the input:
   - Create a 26-element frequency array counting each character
   - Use this frequency array as a key in the map
   - Append the original string to the group for that key
3. Collect all groups from the map into the result array

## üßÆ Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(m √ó n)
**Quick Calculation:**
- m strings to process
- Each string of length n takes O(n) to count characters
- Total: m √ó O(n) = O(m √ó n)

### Space Complexity: O(m √ó n)
**Quick Check:**
- Map stores all m strings
- Each string has length n
- Additional O(26) = O(1) per frequency array

| Metric  |  Complexity | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Time**  | O(m √ó n) | count characters in m strings |
| **Space** | O(m √ó n) | store all strings |
